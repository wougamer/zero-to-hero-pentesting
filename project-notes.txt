        Use NAT Network Adapter
    User Name- root
    Password- toor

3) KeepNote- 27:30
    Don't keep notes within the virtual machine. If the machine crashes or isn't 
        backed up, they are lost forever.

    The appealing part of this software isn't the sturcturing of notes needed
        for the PENTesting/Hacking process, but being able to take snapshops
        within the noted section/file. The application used for sceenshots 
        is Greenshot.

Example of a KeepNote Structure for a PENTest client:
    F = Folder
    f = File

    F. Example
    |- f. Internal
    |  |- f. Vulnerabilities
    |  |  |- f. LLMNR Poisoning
    |  |  |- f. Token Impersonation
    |  |  |- f. Net commands allowed
    |  |  |- f. Patching
    |  |  |- f. SMB v1 
    |  |  |- f. Unsigned SMB 
    |  |  |- f. Default Credentials
    |  |- f. Paths of DA 
    |  |- f. Strongs Controls
    |- f. Trash

    Once a folder is completed you add a check next to say LLMNR poisoning.

    Image cpature software Greenshot features:
        Border, invert color, blur words(obfuscation), border specific areas
            of a screenshot.
