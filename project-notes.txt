    Workstation 15.5.

2) Install Kali Linux- 21:30
    Add the Kali Linux Virtual Machine
    The Added Settings:
        Use NAT Network Adapter
    User Name- root
    Password- toor
    Change Password Command:
        passwd 

3) KeepNote- 27:30
    Don't keep notes within the virtual machine. If the machine crashes or isn't 
        backed up, they are lost forever.

    The appealing part of this software isn't the sturcturing of notes needed
        for the PENTesting/Hacking process, but being able to take snapshops
        within the noted section/file. The application used for sceenshots 
        is Greenshot.

Example of a KeepNote Structure for a PENTest client:
    F = Folder
    f = File

    F. Example
    |- f. Internal
    |  |- f. Vulnerabilities
    |  |  |- f. LLMNR Poisoning
    |  |  |- f. Token Impersonation
    |  |  |- f. Net commands allowed
    |  |  |- f. Patching
    |  |  |- f. SMB v1 
    |  |  |- f. Unsigned SMB 
    |  |  |- f. Default Credentials
    |  |- f. Paths of DA 
    |  |- f. Strongs Controls
    |- f. Trash

    Once a folder is completed you add a check next to say LLMNR poisoning.

    Image cpature software Greenshot features:
        Border, invert color, blur words(obfuscation), border specific areas
            of a screenshot.

    VIEWING, EDITING, CREATING FILES
        Create File:
            echo "hello" > hello.txt
        
        See the Contents:
            cat hello.txt

        Remote File:
            rm hello.txt 
        
        Also Add File By:
            touch hello2.txt

        Also Add File Through nano:
            nano hello3.txt
        Hit ctrl + x to save content

        Install gedit:
            apt-get install *gedit*

        Update Machine:
            apt update && apt upgrade

        Install git automatically: 
            apt install git -y

        Install ftp:
            apt install ftp

        PROCESS OF UNINSTALLING AND REINSTALLING AN APPLICATION
        Add Impacket:
            First purge everything to do with impacket:
                apt purge *impacket*
            Switch to the opt folder for downloads
                cd /opt/
            Clone the repository from GitHub
                git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git
            NOTE: the pip packet-manager needed to be installed:
                apt-get install python-pip 
            From the impacket directory run:
                pip install .

        Turn services on and off
            Start a web server:
                service apache2 start
            Enter IP address within a browser which will show a default apache
                page.
            Also start ssh:
                service ssh start
            Plus start postgresql which works with metasploit:
                service postgresql start
            For this lesson will won't need the apache2 server, so to stop it:
                service apache2 stop
            Run ctl for the needed services to automatically run at reboot for 
                the virtual machine:
                systemctl enable ssh
                systemctl enable postgresql
