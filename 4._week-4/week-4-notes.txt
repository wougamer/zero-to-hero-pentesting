The Five Stages of Hacking
    1. Reconnaissance
        - Passive vs Active(Mentor considers this more a level 2)
    2. Scanning and Enumeration
        - Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, etc.
    3. Gaining Access
    4. Maintaining Access
    5. Convering Tracks

Passive Recon - Physical/Social
    Location Information
        - Satellite images
        - Drone Recon
        - Building layout (badge readers, break areas, security, fencing)
    Job Information 
        - Employees (name, job title, phone number, manager, etc.)
        - Pictures (badge photos, desk photos, computer photos, etc.)
    NOTE: Look into Boss Cloner(make custom tool)

Passive Recon - Web/Host
    Target Validation
        - WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon
    Finding Subdomains
        - Google Fu, dig, Nmap, Sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh, etc.
    Fingerprinting
        - Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat
    Data Breaches
        - HavelBeenPwned and similar lists

Lastly: There are a lot of OSINT Tools. Please don't hate me if we don't cover them all.

FIND people with a specific email: hunter.io- 50 free per month
    - Use creddump maybe?
    - Cleartext Passwords- Github- tensorflow-1.4-billion-password-analysis
    - Mentor using a parser.sh program
    - Check Website, Google maps


Google Search, Take out all sub-directories:
    site:tesla.com -www
Look for docs:
    site:tesla.com filetypr:pdf
NOTE: Use theHarvester in Kali Linux with a terminal script such as:
    theHarvester -d tesla.com -l 500 -b google

Search your email address for possible data breaches with haveibeenpwned.
A tool to use for this on Kali it Bluto. Does some active recon such as zone transfers, brute
    forcing. Don't just run this tool on any site, Telsa is exceptable as there on the 
    bugbounty program.
Install Bluto:
    pip install bluto
NOTE: Was issues in this file for import olefile:
    gedit /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Bluto/modules/data_mine.py
NOTE: Interesting tool for subdomains mentioned: NetCraft. Another tool: 
    https://crt.sh/    Example: %.tesla.com

Fingerprinting
    Wappalyzer- Shows what tech is used in a website.

    BuiltWith Website.

    Use whatweb also which is borderline active scanning. Run the script:
        whatweb -v tesla.com

    Could use old bounty reports and the wayback machine as well.
    Could use old bugbounty reports through hackerone.
